# THIS IS A FORK

This is my own personal fork of Priit Kallas' gamepad.js library. I have modified it slightly for use in my own asherwunk/pygjs (PyGame in NodeWebkit/Browser).  I forked it so that I can perform a commit showing all my customizations (there are few)

This library is integrated into asherwunk/gamejs

# What's Different

I modified some arguments passed in the event firing, they were being hidden behind proto properties when I needed them firstclass
